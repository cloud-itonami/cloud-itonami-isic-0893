(ns saltops.sim
  "Demo driver -- `clojure -M:run`. Walks a clean production-record
  logging request through intake -> advise -> govern -> decide ->
  approval -> commit at phase 1 (assisted-production, always
  approval), then re-runs the same op at phase 3 (supervised-auto,
  clean + high confidence -> auto-commit), then a maintenance-
  scheduling request and a shipment-coordination request (also
  auto-commit clean at phase 3), then a safety-concern flag (ALWAYS
  escalates, at any phase -- approve, then commit), then HARD-hold
  scenarios: an unregistered site, a site registered but not yet
  verified, a proposal whose own `:effect` is not `:propose`, and a
  proposal that has drifted into the permanently-excluded extraction-
  equipment-control/site-safety-authority scope."
