(ns saltops.store
  "SSoT for the ISIC-0893 salt-extraction OPERATIONS-COORDINATION actor,
  behind a `Store` protocol so the backend is a swap, not a rewrite -- the
  same seam every `cloud-itonami-isic-*` actor in this fleet uses.

  This actor coordinates the BACK OFFICE of a salt-extraction site. ISIC
  0893 covers more than one extraction method -- rock-salt (dry/
  underground) mining AND solution mining (brine extraction via
  injection/extraction wells, pumped to evaporation ponds or vacuum-pan
  evaporators) -- and this store's demo data seeds a site of each kind
  deliberately, so the actor is never accidentally coupled to a single
  method. It never touches extraction-equipment control (continuous-
  miner operation, drill-and-blast sequencing, room-and-pillar
  excavation sequencing, brine-well pump control, cavern-pressure
  control, evaporation-pond gate/valve control) or any site-safety(-
  authority) decision -- see `saltops.governor`'s
  `scope-exclusion-violations`, a HARD, permanent, un-overridable block.

  `MemStore` -- atom of EDN. The deterministic default for dev/tests/demo
  (no deps). A `sites` directory keyed by `:site-id` STRING (never a
  keyword -- `cloud-itonami-isic-0510`'s own prior scaffold attempt keyed
  the seed map with keyword site-ids while every lookup used the string
  `:site-id` off the proposal, so `(get sites site-id)` silently missed
  on every call and masked itself as HARD site-unverified holds across
  10 assertions; avoided here by keying consistently on the string from
  the start).

  A registered/verified site record must exist before ANY proposal for
  that site may ever commit or escalate -- `saltops.governor`'s
  `site-unverified-violations` re-derives this from the site's own
  `:registered?`/`:verified?` fields, never from proposal self-report,
  the SAME 'ground truth, not self-report' discipline every sibling
  actor's own governor uses.

  The ledger stays append-only: which site a proposal targeted, which
  operation, on what basis, committed/held/escalated and approved by
  whom is always a query over an immutable log.")
